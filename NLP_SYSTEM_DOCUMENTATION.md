## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. **Advanced Feature Engineering** (`advanced_nlp_features.py`)

**Purpose:** Extract sophisticated linguistic and semantic features

**Features Extracted (58 total):**
- **Linguistic Features (13):** Readability scores, complexity metrics, vocabulary diversity
- **Sentiment Features (8):** VADER + TextBlob sentiment analysis
- **POS Features (5):** Part-of-speech tag ratios and distributions
- **Named Entity Features (7):** Person, organization, location detection
- **BERT Embeddings (12):** Semantic representation vectors
- **Enhanced Policy Features (13):** Advanced violation pattern detection

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Initialize extractor
extractor = AdvancedNLPFeatureExtractor()

# Process single review
features = extractor.extract_all_advanced_features(text)

# Process entire dataset
result_df = extractor.process_dataframe(df, 'review_text')
```

**Performance:** Processes 50 reviews in ~30 seconds with full BERT integration

### 2. **Policy Violation Detection** (`policy_detection_system.py`)

**Purpose:** Multi-layered detection of policy violations with explanations

**Detection Categories:**
- **Advertisement Detection:** URLs, promotional language, contact info, social media
- **Irrelevant Content:** Technology mentions, off-topic discussions, unrelated activities
- **Rant Without Visit:** Direct admission, hearsay indicators, second-hand information

**Detection Layers:**
1. **Rule-Based Detection:** High-precision pattern matching with confidence scoring
2. **ML-Based Detection:** Trained ensemble models (Random Forest + Logistic Regression)
3. **Ensemble Combination:** Weighted combination based on confidence levels

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Initialize detector
detector = PolicyViolationDetector()

# Apply rule-based detection
results = detector.detect_violations_rules(df)

# Train ML models
feature_columns = detector.train_ml_models(train_df, train_df.columns)

# Get ensemble predictions
final_results = detector.create_ensemble_predictions(df)
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- Advertisement Detection: High precision with detailed explanations
- Irrelevant Content: Effective technology/off-topic detection
- Rant Detection: 100% accuracy on "never been" patterns

### 3. **Complete NLP Pipeline** (`nlp_pipeline.py`)

**Purpose:** Integrated end-to-end processing pipeline

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. Basic text preprocessing
2. Basic policy feature extraction
3. Advanced NLP feature engineering
4. Rule-based policy detection
5. ML model training/prediction
6. Ensemble combination
7. Performance evaluation

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = ComprehensiveNLPPipeline()

# Train on synthetic data
train_results = pipeline.process_training_data(train_df)

# Process validation data
val_results = pipeline.process_validation_data(val_df)

# Evaluate performance
pipeline.evaluate_performance(results)

# Single review prediction
prediction = pipeline.predict_single_review(text)
```

### 4. **Topic Modeling** (`topic_modeling.py`)

**Purpose:** Discover hidden themes in restaurant reviews

**Methods Available:**
- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation):** Probabilistic topic modeling
- **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization):** Matrix-based topic discovery

**Restaurant Themes Detected:**
- Food Quality & Taste
- Service & Staff
- Ambiance & Atmosphere
- Value & Pricing
- Location & Convenience
- Overall Experience

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Initialize modeler
modeler = RestaurantTopicModeler(n_topics=8)

# Analyze dataset topics
result_df, summary = modeler.analyze_dataset_topics(df)

# Get single review insights
insights = modeler.get_review_insights(text)
```

### 5. **Keyword Extraction** (`keyword_extraction.py`)

**Purpose:** Extract meaningful keywords and phrases for insights

**Extraction Methods:**
- **TF-IDF Keywords:** Statistical importance scoring
- **POS-Based Keywords:** Part-of-speech filtered terms
- **Named Entity Extraction:** Restaurant/location/person mentions
- **Category Keywords:** Domain-specific term matching
- **Aspect-Based Keywords:** Feature-specific term extraction
- **Sentiment Phrases:** Positive/negative expression detection

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Initialize extractor
extractor = RestaurantKeywordExtractor()

# Comprehensive analysis
results = extractor.analyze_review_keywords(df)

# Single review keywords
keywords = extractor.get_review_keywords(text)
```

## 🎯 Policy Detection Results

### Performance on Test Cases

**Advertisement Detection:**
```
✅ "Visit our website www.promo.com for 50% off!" 
   → Detected with 1.00 confidence
   → Explanation: Contains website reference; Contains discount offer

❌ "Great food and excellent service!"
   → Not detected (0.00 confidence)
   → Correct negative prediction
```

**Irrelevant Content Detection:**
```
✅ "I love my iPhone but this place is noisy for calls"
   → Advanced patterns detect technology mentions

❌ "Amazing pasta and friendly staff"
   → Correctly identified as relevant restaurant review
```

**Rant Without Visit Detection:**
```
✅ "Never been here but heard it's terrible from friends"
   → Perfect detection with 1.00 confidence
   → Explanation: Admits never visiting; Second-hand information

❌ "Will definitely return next week"
   → Correctly identified as legitimate experience
```
